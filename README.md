By the end of 2019, there were more than 625,000 users who have been registered a stock account in the U.S stock market and began to trade in stock. The stock market is a place where full of opportunities and risks. Some people are rapidly growing their wealth by trading stocks, others have lost a lot of money in the stock market. The success of Warren Buffett proved that the stock market gives an intuitive feedback on one's vision and knowledge of stocks. In other word, how to gain profits from stock trading can be studied and analyzed. The purpose of this project is to use visualize and machine learning tools to study company’s complex financial data and provide end-user a better perspective of those financial data in the future stock investment.

## Objectives:

The primary objective of this project to visualize the financial data that extracted from big tech-companies’ finance reports which are listed on the U.S. stock exchange from 2010 to 2019. Because of a company's financial information can most directly reflect the operation of a company, these data are also tightly bound with their stock price. It would be very useful to build a machine learning data model that reveal the effects to their stock price of each financial factor and the hidden coefficient. Finally, visualize the top 10 important factors’ coefficients of the data model and give end-user a good inspiration in their future stock investment.
